### Final Diagnosis:

- **Unstable angina / NSTEMI (cardiac)**  
  1. Plausible because the patient reports exertional, substernal pressure‑type chest pain lasting 3‑5 min, radiation to the left shoulder, and has multiple cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, long‑term smoking, family history of early MI).  
  2. Cause: primarily cardiac – requires ECG, cardiac enzymes and coronary imaging to confirm or exclude.

- **Panic Disorder (psychological)**  
  1. Plausible because the chest pain and palpitations occur abruptly, last only a few minutes, are accompanied by intense fear of a heart attack, and have markedly increased over the past few days; the patient also shows persistent anxiety, sleep disturbance, and catastrophic thinking, all classic features of panic attacks.  
  2. Cause: psychological – the somatic symptoms are driven by autonomic hyper‑reactivity during panic episodes; cardiac disease must still be ruled out, but the pattern fits a primary anxiety disorder.

- **Mixed “Cardiac‑Anxiety Syndrome” (combined cardiac and psychological)**  
  1. Plausible as the patient’s coronary risk profile and possible early coronary artery disease can produce chest discomfort, while chronic anxiety and hyper‑vigilance amplify symptom perception, create a feedback loop of pain‑induced anxiety, and sustain both the cardiac and psychosomatic components.  
  2. Cause: mixed – both underlying coronary pathology (e.g., stable/unstable angina or microvascular ischemia) and a heightened anxiety response contribute to the clinical picture; management should address both aspects.

- **不稳定型心绞痛 / NSTEMI（心脏因素）**  
  1. 该诊断合理，因为患者出现活动后胸骨后压榨样疼痛，放射至左肩，持续 3‑5 分钟，且具备高血压、血脂异常、长期吸烟、父亲早发心肌梗死等多项冠心病危险因素。  
  2. 原因：主要为心脏因素，需要通过心电图、心肌酶及冠脉影像学检查进一步确认或排除。

- **惊恐障碍（心理因素）**  
  1. 该诊断合理，因为胸痛、心悸突发且持续时间短，伴随强烈的心脏病发作恐惧感，近几天发作频率明显增加；患者还有持续焦虑、失眠、灾难化思维，符合惊恐发作的典型表现。  
  2. 原因：心理因素，症状由惊恐发作时的交感神经亢奋引起；仍需
